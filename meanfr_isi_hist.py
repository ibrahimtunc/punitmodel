TODO:   +add mean fire rate in hist DONE
      
        +Normalize ISI axis in form of EODf DONE
      
        +Plot the sinus and spikes also in a second axis DONE
      
        +Make a model where probability to get a spike in a cycle is fixed number (0.2). For that take random number 
        generator (randn) and do logical indexing np.where(). Poisson spike train DONE in poisson_spike.py
      
        +Do amplitude modulation on the sinus with different contrasts (contrast is the same as amplitude modulation).
        The idea is using a step function -> sin()*(1+step) where the amp of the step function varies. The code main.py
        has a function which gives you the firing rate as a function of time, use that to get the firing rate. For a 
        given cell (choose yourself a nice one), do multiple trials of amplitude modulated stimulus and average over 
        multiple trials (15-20 trials). Then on this average find the baseline value (where there is no amp modulation,
        average firing rate there, actually what you had in the loop of this script) and get the highest deviation from
        that (positive or negative). This will be the initial firing rate. Then get the steady state firing rate, where
        the firing rate stays +- constant although stimulus is still amplitude modulated (the offset response is btw not 
        of relevance). Then plot those values against the contrast (amplitude modulation) values to see what's up.
        (BLACKBOARD HAS A SKETCH OF HOW STUFF SHOULD LOOK LIKE, HOPE THAT THANG STAYS THERE XD)
    
        +Play around with the model, see how the parameters change/unfold over time, check behavior in different 
        parameters. See also how different voltages behave over time.
        
        +Feel free to do other works you have :) Jan Benda comes at around 14.30 on 08.09
